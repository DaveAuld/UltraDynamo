General
-------
Rolling Road for the Open Road!

Monitor your vehicle dynamics using your Ultrabook sensors!

Using the various sensors in your Ultrabook it is possible to see how your car etc. performs. What g forces are being pulled, what roll are you experiencing.
If you provide your vehicle weight (including occupants), it should also be possible to determine your net horsepower under acceleration.
Hopefully more features to come soon!

The application contains a basic dashboard with the key performance metrics displayed. You can also open up a number of different display gauges(dials) and real time trends.
