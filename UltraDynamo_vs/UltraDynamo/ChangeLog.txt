-------------------------------------------
New Features: All New. First Release of Application as part of the Intel AppUp Competition.

Changes: none.

Fixes: mone.

Known Issues:
1) There appears to be an underlying issue with the GPS Sensor. This has been discussed on the internet at;
	a) http://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/topic/332589
	b) http://www.codeproject.com/script/Awards/View.aspx?cid=598&msg=4412294#xx4412294xx

	This may prevent the Speedometer and Net Horsepower functions from working. If the issue is resolved with a driver fix, the
	displays may start to work, but at present, they have not been fully tested due to the underlying fault.
