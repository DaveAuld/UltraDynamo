# UltraDynamo
----
### Rolling road for the open road.

UltraDynamo was an entry into the 2012 Intel AppInnovation competition. The competition was ultimately aimed at showcasing the new sensor technologies that were being built into the new 'ultrabook' specification at the time.

The first part of the competition was to submit a proposal to the competition. This was reviewed by the panel and a number of entries were selected, and received prototype ultrabooks from intel for developing the app on.

The link below is to the initial concept submission, and a progress update through the open window of the 2nd phase of the competition.

An app had to be submitted and published in the App Store, fully code signed and Intel verified to be considered to go through to the final stages.

There were 7 categories in the competition. UltraDynamo was the winning submission in the Entertainment category. Unfortunately, it did not win the Grand Prize, which was selected from the 7 category winners. Not a bad effort however!

### Secondary Competition  
Following completion of the Intel competition, an article writing competition was held by CodeProject which focused on the writer narrating their experiences throughout the primary competition. 
The UltraDynamo article took 1st Place in this article competition. The link to this winning 5-part article can be found below.

### Case Study
Intel approached the author of UltraDynamo to write a case study on the author and the application/competition. The published case study can be found in this repository at https://github.com/DaveAuld/UltraDynamo/blob/master/IDZC_Case_Study_UltraDynamo_28May2013_final.pdf

### Closure of AppUp Center
On March 11, 2014 Intel closed the AppUp Center.

This repository has been created to host the application source.
